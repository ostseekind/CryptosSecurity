"Dear Sir or Madam,
You got hacked! (Did nobody tell you that "monkey" is a really stupid password?!).
Anyway I have stolen your complete identity and locked it up in a box (together with your cat). To get it back transer 10.000â‚¬ to IBAN DE91500105174425265142 until <date>. If you fail I will delete the key and you will be erased from eternity!
Sincerely,
Captain Crypto"
